How to Read, Write, Present Papers
Nitin H. Vaidya

Summary
    - Use common sense
    - Learn from experience


Reading a Paper

Why read papers
    - So you know what's hapening
    - Aavoid reinventing the wheel
        * Does happen commonly, to many wheels already
    - Find interesting research topics

Why not to read papers
    - Cannot read everything
    - Should not read everything
    - Can suppress innovation
        * once you see solutions using a particular there, often hard to think differently

Read or not read, that is the question
    - Read, of course
    - Know what's important
    - Know what can be ignored

What to read
    - Major conferences
        * Journals are a few years behind, but still can be useful
    - Tech reports from active research groups
        * need to know which groups to look up
    - Survey / overview papers
        * ACM Computing Surveys
        * CACM, IEEE Computer, Spectrum
        * More technical - IEEE personal Communications, ...
        * newsletters - ACM SIGCOMM, ACM, SIGMOBILE, ACM SIGBED...

What's In a paper
    - Abstract
    - Introduction
    - Motivation
    - Problem description
    - Solution
    - ...
    - Performance Analysis
    - Conclusions
    - Future Work

How to read a paper
Know why you want to read the paper
    - To know what's going on (e.g. scanning proceedings)
        * title, authors, abstract
    - Papers in your broad research area
        * introduction, motivation, solution description, summary, conclusions
        * sometimes reading more details useful, but not always
    - Papers you may want to improve on
        * read entire paper carefully

What to note
    - Authors and research groups
        * need to know where to look for a paper on particular topic
    - Theme of the solution
        * should be able to go back to the paper if you need more info
    - Approach to performance evaluation
    - Note any shortcomings (Not reinventing wheels)

So this paper is in print
    - Be skeptical
    - If it sounds too good to be true, it often is


How to Write

How to write a paper
    - Do unto others as you would have them do unto you

How to write a paper
When you have truly exceptional results ex. P == NP
    - Probably doesn't matter how you write, people will read it anyway

How to write a paper
    - Most papers are not that exceptional
    - Good writing makes significaln difference
    - Better to say little clearly, than saying too much unclearly

Readability a must
    - If the paper is not readable, author has not given writing sufficient thought
    - Two kinds of referees
        * if I cannot understand the paper, it is the writer's fault
        * if I cannot understand the paper, I cannot critisize it

Do not irritate the reader
    - Define notation before use
    - No one is impressed anymore by Greek symbols
    - If you use much notation, make it easy to find
        * Summarize most notation in one place
    - Aviod using too many acronyms
    - You may know the acronyms well. Do not assume the reader does

How to write a theory paper
    - Unreadability is not the same as formalism
    - Reader should be able to understand contributions without reading all details
    - if some proofs are not too important, relegate them to an appendix

How to write a systems paper
    - Provide sufficient information to allow people to reproduce your results
        * people may want to reproduce exciting results
        * do not assume this won't happen to your paper
        * besides, referees expect the information
    - Do not provide wrong info
    - Sometimes hard to probide all details in available space
        * may be forced to omit some info
        * judge what is most essential to the experiments
        * cite a tech report for more info

Discuss related work
    - Explain how your work relates to state of the art
    - Discuss relevant past work by other people too
    - Remember, they may be reviewing your paper
        * Avoid: the scheme presented by Vaidya performs terrible
        * Prefer: The scheme by Vaidya does not perform as well in scenario X as it does in scenario Y
    - Avoid offending people, unless you must

Tell them your shortcomings
    - If your ideas do not work well in some interesting scenarios, tell the reader
    - People appreciate a balanced presentation

How to write weak results
    - If results are not that great, come up with better ones
    - Do not hide weak results behind bad writing
    - If you must publish: write well, but may have to go to second-best conference
    - If results not good enough for a decent conference, rething your problem/solution

Misc
    - Read some well-written papers
        * award-winning papers from conferences
    - Avoid long sentences
    - If you have nothing to say, say nothing
        * don't feel obliged to fill up space with useless text
        * if you must fill all available space, use more line spacing, greater margins, bigger font, bigger figures, anything but drivel
    
Technical Reports
    - Useful to get early

How to Present

How to present a paper
    - Do unto others as you would have them do unto you

How to present a paper (at a conference)
    Objectives, in decreasing order of importance
    - Keep people awake and attentive
        * everything has been tried: play fiddle, cartoons, jokes
        * in most cases, extreme measures should not be needed
        * humor can help
    - Get the problem definition across
        * people in audience may not be working on your problem
    - Explain your general approach
        * most productive use of your time
    - Dirty details
        * most people in the audience probably do not care
        * a typical conference includes 30+ presentations

Talk outline or not?
    - Useful when several ideas discussed in a signle talk
    - Short talks: skip the outline
    - Long talks: include an outline
    - Make the outline interesting

Text
    You want people to (quickly) read your slides
    - Use big enough font
    - Do not put too mcuh on one slide
        * don't want to keep them busy reading, instead of listening
    - Use good colour schemes
    - Slide text need to be grammatically accurate
    - Keep it short
        * OK to omit some details
        * Fill them in when you present the paper
    Practice makes perfect
        vs
    Practice can improve your presentation

PowerPoint but not excessively
    - Everybody has used PowerPoint
    - No one is impressed

Picture is worth 1000 words
    - Use illustrations to explain complex algorithms
    - Omit minor details, focus on the improtant
    - They can read the paper to know the exact algorithm

How to present a paper
    - Avoid blocking the screen
    - Point to the screen, rather than the slide on the projector

How many slides
    - Depends on personal style
    - Rule of thumb
        * 1 slide for 1-2 min
        * Know you place
    - I tend to make more slide than I might need, and skip the not so important ones dynamically
    - Anticipate techinical questions, and prepare explanatory slides

How to present a paer
    - Practice makes perfect (or tolerable)
    - May need several trials to fit you talk to available time

ESL
    - Accent may not be easy to understand
    - Talk slowly
    - Easier said than done

No substitute for experience
    - Nothing like a terrible presentation to learn what not to do

Summary
    - Use common sens
    - Learn from experience
    - Enjoy
        * papers can be fun



Introduction to Cyber-Physical Systems

Embedded systems
    Computing systems designed for a specific purpose
    Predecessor to Cyber-physical systems
    They are everywhere

Embedded systems and the Market
    Quiz: What % of today's current CPU shipment if destined to PC?
    Answer: less than 1%
    In fact embedded processor shipments surpassed PCs back in 1988

Trend 1: Embedded systems are getting more complex
    - Modern cars hage over 100 processors
    - Increasing number of sensors, actuators, smart control, GUI
    - Intelligent data fusion

Ex: General automotive system
    - The number of ECUs has more than doubled in 10 years
        Many cars have more than 100 ECUs

Trend 2: Embedded systems are getting more connected
    - Command and control network - real time integration of vehicles, people, command
    - Geotagging
    - Many other ex
        * power grid
        * medical systems
        * transportation
        * etc

Ex: v2v and v2x
    - v2v: vehicle to vehicle
    - v2x vehicle to pedestrian, vehicle to road site unit, ...

CPS - The next Evolution
    - Integration fo computation with the physical process
    - Built on top of the embedded computing systems
    - Interaction with the physical environment is promoted to a "first class"
    - Promotes interaction and integration of subsystems
        * classic saftey-critical embedded systesm: black boxes
        * CPS: white-boxes, open protocols
    - Main goals:
        * co-design the cyber and physical part of the system
        * Engineer a "system of systems"

CPS applications
    - Several new application only possible thanks to the CPS revolution
    - Integrated operating room: seemingly connect medical devices, plug-and-play functionality
        - Currently: a cable mess
    - Smart power grid: predict and resposen to varying conditions in supply and demand of power
    - An often ignored requirement for sustainable energy...
    - Other application are an evoluto of existing systems
        * UAV
        * Autonomous Vehicles

Control View of CPS
    Cyber Space            ^->      Controller              -> v
                        Sensor                              Actuator
    Physical Space         ^<-      Physical system         <- v

CPS Requirements
    1. Saftey
        - all such systems interact with the environment
        - system failure can have catastrophic consequences
        - system correctness depends on both logical results and the time at whic results are produced (real-time)
    2. Performance
        - safety is #1 requirement, but we still need to achieve sufficient performance
        - many systems are resource constrained (in either weight, power, cost, etc)
    3. Interoperability (talking to each other)
        - Individual subsystems connected by open protocols
        - security can be an issue

Reliable CPS: not so much
    - In 2007, 12 F-22s were going from Hawaii to Japan
    - After crossing the IDL, all 12 experienced multible crashes
        - No nav
        - No fuel subsystems
        - Limited comms
        - Rebooting didn't help
    - F-22 has 1.7(?) mil line of code
    - Mercedes Class A failed the moose test in 97
    - Sensor on roof detect overturn and auto open door
    - What happens if a thief jumps on the car roof?

CPS Challenges - Safety
    - Safety is har to guarantee in interconnected and interdependent systems
    1. Do not trues communication channels
    2. Do not trust users
    3. Do not trust lower-critically subsystems
        * protect life-critical subsystems, make sure lower do not affect higher

CPS Challenges - Timing Predictability
    - The biggels architectural and system challenge
    - The lowest abstraction layer (transistors) is pretty deterministic - we know how to compute exast timings
    - However, higher levels loos all comcept of timing
        * Deep pipelining, caches, out-of-order and speculative execution...
        * Thread models, locking, interrupts...
    - This is fine for general purpose computing, but not for CPS - the physical system uses real time!
    - We need to ensure that computation always finishes within guarantee time windows -> we are interested in worst-case performance, not average performance!
    - Timing predictability
        * The time that the system requries to perform an poeration should exibit little variation
        * Such time should be easy to compute
        * It should not be affected by other parallel operations in the system.

CPS Challenge - Security
    - Interconnected systems are also open to attacks
    - Security can become a significant concern
        * Integrity & availability are often more important than confidentiality, but not always


Research Topics

Security In CPS

CPS security incidents
    Siberian pipeline: June 1982:
        - Soviets stole control software from Canadian company
        - UE influence Canadian company to alter code such that pipeline pressures would build up
        - Explosion could be sen from space
    Stuxnet: 2009
        - Attack on Iranian nuclear facility
        - Used 4 undiscovered exploits targeting control
    US drome captured: 2011
        - Iran caputred predator drone that landed in the wrong area
        - GPS spoofing
        - "System" worked perfectly
            * sensor measurements where wrong
    IoT DDoS: Oct 21, 2016
        - Thousands of devices overtaken using default passowrds
        - Organized into botnet to flood DNS provider
        - Took down many major websites

Typical CPS Architecture
    - Cyber attack surfaces
        * eg communication, netowrks, computors...
    - Environmental attack surfaces
        * eg GPS signal, electro-magnetic interference...
    - Physical attack surfaces
        * eg locks, casings, cables...
    - Human attack surfaces
        * eg phishing, blackmail ...

What is CPS security?
    - A CPS attack whose goal is to (negatively) affect the interaction between a CPS and the physical workd
        -- originates through any attack surface
    - CPS security concerns the development of technologies for defending against CPS attacks
        -- Discovering new vulnerailities
        -- Detecting CPS attacks
        -- Mitigating attack effects
        -- ...

Ex: Sensor Attacks
    Target: Sensor Attacks
    - The attacker can arbitrarily change sensor measurements
        * environmental attack surfaces
        * cyber attack surfaces
    Goal: Resilience
    - To ensure ....

Ideally...
    - Ideally the system performs (almost) the same as if there is not attack

How sensor attacks affect control?
    1. A sensor attack or fault occurs
    2. The input, ie estimation X, incorrectly reflects the system's physical state
    3. The output ie control input u is misled
    4. The actuator performs the misled actuation
    5. The physical system drifts off

Some Existing Approaches
    _ Approaches rely on sensor redundancy
        * multiple sensors (partially) measure the same physical variables
        * They limit the number of compromised sensors, eg less than half of the total number of sensors
    - CPS checkpointing and recovery
        * Ocasionally store estimates...

Review on CPS security?
    - CPS security concerns the development of technologies for defending against CPS attacks
        -- Discovering new vulnerailities
        -- Detecting CPS attacks
        -- Mitigating attack effects
        -- ...
    - The above example studies how to mitigate effects of sensor attacks
